//! Peer lifecycle state machine.
//!
//! # Contract
//! - State transitions follow: Connecting → Handshaking → Active → Disconnected.
//!   Handshaking can also transition to Failed.
//! - `set_active` produces a `PeerConnected` event.
//! - `set_disconnected` produces a `PeerDisconnected` event.
//! - Invariant: a peer in any state other than `Active` cannot produce `Message` events.
//! - Invariant: state transitions are one-way; no state can transition backwards.
